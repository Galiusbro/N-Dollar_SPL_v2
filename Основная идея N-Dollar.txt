N-Dollar Exchange & Coin Creation Platform Specifications 1. Introduction and Overview
Project Vision:
Develop a decentralized exchange and coin creation platform on the Solana blockchain. Users launch their own meme coins via a Telegram-based DAO interface using N-Dollar as the primary currency. The system employs a symmetric bonding curve for price discovery and leverages a simplified coin creation process where fees are paid entirely in N-Dollar. All incoming funds from N-Dollar purchases (via USDT, TON, BTC, SOL, or bank transfers) are automatically converted into a liquidity pool that pairs N-Dollar with Solana. Additionally, each coin creator receives a unique referral link; when new users sign up through that link, both the creator and the new user receive 1 coin of the created coin.
Key Objectives:
• Enable rapid coin creation with fees paid solely in N-Dollar.
• Build robust liquidity by channeling 100% of N-Dollar proceeds into an N-Dollar/SOL liquidity pool.
• Utilize a symmetric bonding curve for controlled, exponential price discovery.
• Integrate TON-based purchases for N-Dollar via Telegram Wallet.
• Incentivize coin promotion with a targeted referral mechanism that rewards both parties.
• Operate exclusively on Solana for speed, low fees, and simplicity.

2. System Architecture
2.1 Core Components
• Smart Contracts:
• N-Dollar Smart Contract:
• Manages the N-Dollar token supply with scheduled increments.
• Provides admin functions for minting, burning (if necessary), freezing funds, updating metadata, and upgrading contract logic.
• Note: Tokens transacted via the bonding curve are recycled into the liquidity pool (N-Dollar / SOL)  rather than being burned.


• Coin Creation Contracts:
• Standard contracts for launching new meme coins.
• New coins are created entirely with a fee paid in N-Dollar.
• Bonding Smart Contract:
• Establishes the initial liquidity for each new coin by pairing 100% of the N-Dollar fee with Solana.
• Implements a symmetric pricing model where each incremental purchase increases the price by a fixed amount and each sale decreases it by the same amount.
• Telegram Bot / DAO Interface:
• Provides the primary user interface for coin holders.
• Displays key balances for the native/meme coin, N-Dollar, and Solana.
• Sends push notifications on price movements to encourage timely trade actions.
• Supports trading, transfers, and coin management.
• Subsidizes up to three transactions per week (additional transactions require a SOL deposit).
• Referral Functionality:
• Each coin creator receives a unique referral link for the coin’s dedicated Telegram bot.
• When a new user signs up via that referral link, both the coin creator/or user and the new user receive 1 coin of the created coin.
• Backend and Fund Management:
• A centralized account collects all N-Dollar proceeds from coin creation fees, founders’ option purchases, and meme coin purchases.
• Conversion Mechanism:
• 100% of each N-Dollar purchase—whether received via USDT, TON, BTC (via TON Wallet), SOL, or bank transfers—is automatically converted and allocated to the N-Dollar/SOL liquidity pool.
• These funds support three key activities:
A) Coin creation fees
B) Founders’ option coins
C) Purchases of meme coins requiring N-Dollar
• This ensures that every incoming payment directly contributes to robust liquidity.
• Blockchain Integration:
• The ecosystem is built exclusively on the Solana blockchain to leverage its speed and low transaction costs.
• TON Integration for N-Dollar Purchases:
• Users can acquire N-Dollar directly via their Telegram Wallet using TON, expanding access to the platform’s primary currency.
2.2 Data Flows
• Coin Creation Process:
• Users initiate coin creation via the Genesis Bot on Telegram.
• To create a new coin, users pay a creation fee entirely in N-Dollar.
• The bonding smart contract allocates 100% of the fee into the liquidity pool, pairing N-Dollar with Solana.
• Upon coin creation, the coin creator receives a unique referral link for the coin’s Telegram bot.
• Referral Mechanism:
• When a new user signs up to the coin’s Telegram bot via the referral link, both the coin creator/ or user,  and the new user are rewarded with 1 meme coin of that bot each .
• Trading and Swaps:
• Once a coin is created, it is listed in liquidity pools paired with N-Dollar.
• Swap transactions are managed by an automated market maker (AMM) that dynamically sets prices based on current pool balances.
• Note: Users do not need to supply both currencies for swaps—the liquidity pool already contains both N-Dollar and Solana.
• N-Dollar Purchase & Conversion:
• Users purchase N-Dollar using various payment methods (USDT, TON, BTC, SOL, or bank transfers).
• All proceeds from these purchases are automatically converted into the N-Dollar/SOL liquidity pool, ensuring that funds support coin creation fees, founders’ option coins, and purchases of meme coins.

3. Smart Contracts and Tokenomics
3.1 N-Dollar Smart Contract
• Supply Schedule:
• Week 1: 108,000,000 coins.
• Week 2: 54,000,000,000 coins.
• Week 3: 108,000,000,000 coins.
• Week 4: 369,000,000,000 coins (supply remains stable).
• Admin Functions:
• Ability to mint or burn tokens (if needed in exceptional cases).
• Ability to revert transactions, freeze funds, update metadata, and upgrade contract logic.
3.2 New Coin Creation & Distribution (via Genesis Bot)
• Creation Fee:
• Users pay a coin creation fee entirely in N-Dollar.
• Proceeds Allocation: 100% of the N-Dollar fee is directed to the liquidity pool pairing N-Dollar with Solana.
• Founders’ Option:
• The coin creator is granted a one-time option to purchase 10% of the new coin’s total supply at a predetermined rate using N-Dollar immediately after creation.
• Default Coin Supply & Allocation:
• Total Supply: 100,000,000 coins.
• 10% (10,000,000 coins): Reserved for founder allocation.
• 10% (10,000,000 coins): Set aside for future marketing or viral distribution initiatives.
• 50% (50,000,000 coins): Allocated to the operational agent for bounty rewards and mission execution.
• 30% (30,000,000 coins): Offered via the bonding curve sale.
3.3 Symmetric Bonding Curve Mechanics
• Pricing Model:
• Start Price: 0.00005 N-Dollar per coin.
• Exponential Growth: The price increases exponentially based on coins purchased, calibrated so that when 30,000,000 bonding coins are sold, the price reaches 1 N-Dollar per coin.
• Symmetry: Identical incremental changes occur for both buying (price increases) and selling (price decreases).
• Liquidity Recycling: Sold coins are returned to the liquidity pool, preserving overall token supply.
• Secondary Listing Trigger:
• Once the market cap from bonding curve sales reaches a predetermined threshold (e.g., 100,000 N-Dollar), additional liquidity pools (such as on Raydium) may be created using raised funds.

4. Coin Creation Process (Genesis Bot)
4.1 User Flow
1. Initiation of Coin Creation:
• Users interact with the Genesis Bot on Telegram.
• They pay the coin creation fee entirely in N-Dollar.
2. Coin Setup:
• Users input parameters such as the coin’s name, mission, and description.
• The bonding smart contract uses the entire N-Dollar fee to form and bolster the liquidity pool pairing N-Dollar with Solana, thereby launching the new coin.
• The coin creator is offered a one-time option to purchase 10% of the new coin’s total supply at a predetermined rate.
3. Referral Mechanism for Coin Promotion:
• Upon coin creation, the coin creator or any user receives a unique referral link for the coin’s dedicated Telegram bot.
• When a new user signs up via this referral link, both the coin creator or existing user and the new user are rewarded with 1 coin of the created coin.
• This incentive encourages viral promotion and community growth around the coin.
4. Post-Creation:
• A dedicated Telegram bot (DAO) for the new coin is activated.
• The bot provides live updates on balances and prices, and facilitates trading.
• Users receive push notifications on every price movement (limited to not be seen as spam), fostering active engagement.
4.2 Removal of Traditional Airdrop & General Referral Mechanisms
• No Airdrops:
• New user registration does not include any token airdrops.
• No General Referral Rewards:
• Aside from the coin-specific referral reward (1 coin per new signup via the coin creator’s referral link, with both parties receiving 1 coin), no additional tokens are granted for referrals.

5. Trading, Liquidity, and Market Making
5.1 Default Liquidity Pools
• Pairing Rule:
• Every coin created is automatically paired with N-Dollar (e.g., Coin A/N-Dollar, Coin B/N-Dollar, etc.).
• Liquidity Management:
• All N-Dollar proceeds from coin creation fees, founders’ option purchases, and meme coin trades are consolidated into a centralized account.
• These funds are automatically converted and allocated to maintain or expand the N-Dollar/SOL liquidity pool.
• This pool is critical to supporting coin creation fees, founders’ option coins, and meme coin purchases that require N-Dollar.
5.2 Swap Transactions
• Automated Market Maker (AMM):
• Swap transactions occur within liquidity pools governed by an AMM that dynamically sets swap ratios based on current asset balances. 
We will not use that at the start, it should be an option. 

• No Additional Dual-Currency Requirement:
• Unlike coin creation, swap transactions do not require users to supply both currencies—the pool already contains both N-Dollar and Solana.
• Symmetric Price Adjustments:
• The bonding curve mechanism ensures identical incremental changes for both buying and selling, maintaining controlled price dynamics.
5.3 Market Engagement
• User Notifications:
• Push notifications via the Telegram bot alert users to every price change, prompting timely trading decisions and fostering an engaged community.

6. Technical Requirements and Dependencies
• Blockchain:
• The platform is built exclusively on the Solana blockchain to maximize speed, minimize fees, and maintain technical simplicity.
• APIs & Integrations:
• Integration with the Telegram Bot API for managing coin-specific DAOs.
• TON Integration:
• Users can purchase N-Dollar directly via their Telegram Wallet using TON.
• Additional funding methods (USDT, BTC via TON Wallet, SOL, or future bank transfers) are automatically converted into the N-Dollar/SOL liquidity pool.
• Backend & Fund Management:
• A centralized account aggregates all N-Dollar proceeds.
• All incoming funds are converted and allocated to the liquidity pool to support:
• A) Coin creation fees
• B) Founders’ option coins
• C) Purchases of meme coins requiring N-Dollar
• Security:
• Regular audits of all smart contracts.
• Robust measures to ensure the integrity of the bonding curve, coin creation process, and overall system operations.

7. Trading & Swap Mechanism Clarifications
• Coin Creation vs. Swaps:
• Coin Creation:
• Involves a fee paid entirely in N-Dollar.
• 100% of the fee is converted into the liquidity pool pairing N-Dollar with Solana.
• Swaps:
• Occur within liquidity pools using an AMM mechanism.
• Users trade between a coin and N-Dollar without needing to supply both currencies each time.

8. User Interface & Notification System
• Telegram Bot Features:
• Real-time display of balances for the native coin, N-Dollar, and Solana. (This needs to be further discussed how we will display this)
• Push notifications for every price change to prompt user actions.
• Full trading functionalities, including peer-to-peer transfers. (So you can send the coins to an other TG user)
• A dedicated section for managing coin creation (on TG this leads to the TG Genesis ot, referral links etc..
• Engagement Focus:
• Continuous, real-time notifications keep users informed and encourage active market participation.

9. Operational Rules and Governance
• Centralized Control (Initial Phase):
• Admins maintain full control over key functions such as minting, fund management, and smart contract upgrades during early deployment.
• Fund Allocation:
• All N-Dollar proceeds are transfered to centralized account and automatically converted into the N-Dollar/SOL liquidity pool.
• Coin creation fees, founders’ option coins, and meme coin purchases requiring N-Dollar.
